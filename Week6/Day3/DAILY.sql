Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE Book(

INSERT INTO Book
VALUES

Create a table named Student, with the columns : 
student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

CREATE TABLE student (

	name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

John, 12

INSERT INTO student
values

Create a table named Library, with the columns :
book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
borrowed_date




-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables 
-- : A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

CREATE TABLE Library(
    book_fk_id intEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES Book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	student_fk_id intEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES Student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	borrowed_date date,
	primary key (book_fk_id, student_fk_id )
)

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021

SELECT name, title

JOIN book b
on l.book_fk_id = b.book_id
JOIN student s
on l.student_fk_id = s.student_id



Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland

SELECT avg(age) 
FROM library l
join book b
on l.book_fk_id = b.book_id
join student s

Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?

DELETE from student WHERE name = 'Bob'
-- it will be gone gone goennnnn
SELECT * FROM Library
